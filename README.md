Kaggle Competition : Usiing glm and neural networks

Google Cloud and NCAA® have teamed up to bring you this year’s version of the Kaggle machine learning competition. 
Another year, another chance to anticipate the upsets, call the probabilities, and put your bracketology skills
to the leaderboard test. Kagglers will join the millions of fans who attempt to forecast the outcomes of March Madness® 
during this year's NCAA Division I Men’s and Women’s Basketball Championships. But unlike most fans, you will pick your
bracket using a combination of NCAA’s historical data and your computing power, while the ground truth unfolds on national television.

In the first stage of the competition, Kagglers will rely on results of past 
tournaments to build and test models. We encourage you to post any useful external data as a dataset. 
In the second stage, competitors will forecast outcomes of all possible match-ups in the 2018 NCAA Division 
I Men’s and Women’s Basketball Championships. You don't need to participate in the first stage to enter the second.
The first stage exists to incentivize model building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition is
forecasting the 2018 results.
What to predict
Stage 1 - You should submit predicted probabilities for every possible matchup in the past 4 NCAA® tournaments (2014-2017).

Stage 2 - You should submit predicted probabilities for every possible matchup before the 2018 tournament begins.
